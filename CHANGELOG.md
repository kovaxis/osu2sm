# TODO

- Check beatmapset 30876, "Hacking to the gate", since audio is sometimes not playing in StepMania.
- Check beatmapset 22164, "Firework", since the background image sometimes doesn't show up.

# Maybe?

- Use difficulties from `osu!.db`.
- Use `.ssc` instead of `.sm`.
- Perhaps convert taiko and ctb.
- Abort parsing quickly if osu! gamemode or keycount is not compatible.
- Use `bumpalo` for fastness.
- Apply text transformations to difficulty names.
