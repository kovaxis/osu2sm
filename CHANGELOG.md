# Planned changes

- In order to make osu!standard-converted maps, make `Remap` have several alternative map-wide
    pattern sets, where only one is selected using some criteria.

# Wishlist, kinda

- Use difficulties from `osu!.db`.
- Use `.ssc` instead of `.sm`.
- Perhaps convert taiko and ctb.
- Abort parsing quickly if osu! gamemode or keycount is not compatible.
- Use `bumpalo` for fastness.
- Apply text transformations to difficulty names.
