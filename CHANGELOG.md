- Use difficulties from `osu!.db`.
- Use `.ssc` instead of `.sm`.

- Make sure video has priority over background.
- Enable/disable video.
- Only show "fixed path..." message if path actually changes.
- Random deny filter (for the debug purposes of trimming down input size).
- Max simultaneous keys filter.
- Difficulty cutter filter.
- Cache mp3 audio length query.
